> Decisions as I go  
To anywhere I flow  
Sometimes I believe  
At times I'm rational

> I can fly high  
I can go low  
Today I got a million  
Tomorrow I don't know  

> Decisions as I go  
To anywhere I flow  
Sometimes I believe  
At times I'm rational  

> I can fly high  
I can go low  
Today I got a million  
Tomorrow I don't know  

> Stop claiming what you own  
Don't think about the show  
We're all playing the same game  
Waiting on our loan  

> We're unknown and known  
Special and a clone  
Hate will make you cautious  
Love will make you glow  

> Make me feel the warmth  
Make me feel the cold  
It's written in our stories  
It's written on the walls  

> This is our call  
We rise and we fall  
Dancing in the moonlight  
Don't we have it all

Today I got a million

> Make me feel the warmth  
Make me feel the cold

Dancing in the moonlight  
Don't we have it all
